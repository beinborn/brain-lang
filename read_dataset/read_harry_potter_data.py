# This class reads the Harry Potter data that was published by Wehbe et al. 2014
# Paper: http://aclweb.org/anthology/D/D14/D14-1030.pdf
# Data: http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/theo-73/www/plosone/


# It consists of fMRI data from 8 subjects who read chapter 9 of the first book of Harry Potter.
# They see one word every 0.5 seconds.
# A scan is taken every two seconds.
# The chapter was presented in four blocks of app. 12 minutes.
# Voxel size: 3 x 3 x 3

# Note: for future experiments, check the comments on sentence tokenization below.
