# In: List of voxel vectors, list of stimuli vectors
# Out: Score for quality of stimuli vectors
# Challenge: How can we best evaluate representations for continuous language?

# Parameters:
# evaluation measure: 2x2, accuracy, explained variance, ...?
# setup: cross-validation setting, train-test split etc
# hemodynamic delay
# mode of representation combination (concatenation, average etc)
# --> maybe the combination mode could also be decided earlier when loading representations
